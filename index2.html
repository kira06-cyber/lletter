            <p>
                ðŸŽ¶ I can think of all the times<br>
                You told me not to touch the light<br>
                I never thought that you would be the one<br>
                I couldn't really justify<br>
                How you even thought it could be right<br>
                'Cause everything we cherished is gone<br>
                And in the end, can you tell me if it was worth the try?<br>
                So I can decide<br>
                Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees<br>
                And all will be alright in time<br>
                From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas<br>
                And all will be alright in time<br>
                Oh, you never really love someone until you learn to forgive<br>
                Try as hard as I might<br>
                To flee the shadows of the night<br>
                It haunts me, and it makes me feel blue<br>
                But how can I try to hide<br>
                When every breath and every hour<br>
                I still end up thinking of you?<br>
                And in the end, everything we have makes it worth the fight<br>
                So I will hold on for as long<br>
                As leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees<br>
                And all will be alright in time<br>
                From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas<br>
                And all will be alright in time<br>
                Oh, you never really love someone until you learn to forgive<br>
                I never thought that I would see the day<br>
                That I'd decide if I should leave or stay<br>
                But in the end, what makes it worth the fight's<br>
                That no matter what happens, we try to make it right<br>
                Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees<br>
                And all will be alright in time<br>
                From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas<br>
                And all will be alright in time<br>
                Wounds of the past will eventually heal<br>
                And all will be alright in time<br>
                'Cause all of this comes with a love that is real<br>
                I said, "All will be alright in time"<br>
                I said, "All will be alright in time"<br>
                I said, "All will be alright in time"<br>
                And all will be alright in time<br>
                Oh, you never really love someone until you learn to forgive<br>
                You learn to forgive<br>
                Learn to forgive. ðŸŽ¶
