                    I know I have already confessed to you but I'm gonna do it again. Every time I see you, my heart does a little happy dance.
                    From the moment I saw you, you have caught my eyes. Hindi man halata sa umpisa and hindi mo man naramdaman, but i like you before i even knew your name.
                    I like everything about you, and I am low-key crushing hard on you. You have this amazing ability to turn even the simplest moments into something special, 
                    and I find myself smiling more whenever you are near. I'm really sorry about the things na hindi natin napag usapan before, I'm afraid eh, I'm afraid na baka you won't be the same with me anymore, so i kept my mouth shut.
                    I love the way you hold me, the way that you are so caring towards me. Mas na I like you pa lalo nung we started sleeping together.<br>
                    I know that there will be no chance talaga but just let me show you my affection, although, tell me <b>PLEASE TELL ME</b> if you want me to stop na, if you get uncomfortable from all of this, tell me lng po okay?<br>
                    <br>
                    Anyway, <b>♥Happy Valentines my beloved♥</b><br>
                    Even if we aren't together, you. are. still. mine. mwehehehe. Hohays , as a friend nalang tong letter na to haAhaha, time check it's 10:25 rn and i'm almost done coding. Wag kana magtanong ilang oras ko ginawa to, basta, i made this with love eheu.
                    Sana magustuhan mo to baby ko♥.
